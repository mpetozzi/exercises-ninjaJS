#Boring Function, Happy Cache!
Let's think about a boring function in JavaScript. A really annoying function for the user, one that can take a lot of time to compute a result that is deterministic. A black box that given inputs requires a lot of time to compute and, unfortunately, you need to call it a lot of time. Wow, it's really boring.

Hmm, let's give it a shot! Cache the result and make all more Happy! :D
